## Java is a verbose language.
**In the context of programming, "verbose" can refer to excessive output or detailed information provided by a program, 
which can make it harder to read and understand. It may also refer to code that uses a lot of unnecessary or lengthy statements to achieve a simple task.**
### Boilerplate Code: 
**Java requires a lot of boilerplate code for common tasks. 
For example, writing a simple "Hello World" program in Java requires 
creating a class, defining a main method, and including package declarations. This additional code can make Java programs appear more verbose.**
